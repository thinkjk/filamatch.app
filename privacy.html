    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 30, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>FilaMatch ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>FilaMatch is designed with privacy in mind. Here's what data is collected:</p>

    <h3>Data Stored Locally (On Your Device Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images you capture are processed entirely on your device. We do not upload, store, or have access to your photos.</li>
      <li><strong>Search History:</strong> Your search history is stored locally on your device only. We cannot access it.</li>
      <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Your saved favorites are stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Sent to Third-Party Services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Color Data:</strong> When you select a color, only the hex color code (e.g., #FF5733) is sent to the FilamentColors.xyz API to find matching filaments. No personal information is included in this request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics (provided by Google) to help us understand how the app is used and to identify and fix crashes. These services may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, and screen size</li>
      <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Features used, session duration, and app version</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> A resettable identifier used for analytics purposes (you can reset or opt out of this in your device settings)</li>
      <li><strong>Crash Data:</strong> If the app crashes, technical information about the crash is collected to help us fix bugs</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> Country or region based on IP address (not precise location)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used solely to improve the app and fix issues. We do not sell this data or use it for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
    <p>FilaMatch requires camera access to capture photos for color matching. This permission is used solely for this purpose. Photos are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processed locally on your device</li>
      <li>Not uploaded to any server</li>
      <li>Not stored permanently (temporary files are cleaned up)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>FilaMatch uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FilamentColors.xyz API:</strong> We send color codes to this service to retrieve matching filament information. Please review their privacy practices at <a href="https://filamentcolors.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filamentcolors.xyz</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Provided by Google to help us understand app usage. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can control your data in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> You can reset or opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings (Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Ads on Android, or Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking on iOS)</li>
      <li><strong>Delete Local Data:</strong> Uninstalling the app will delete all locally stored data including search history and favorites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
